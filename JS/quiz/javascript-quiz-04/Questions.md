Question 1: 
Create a new variable named penguins and set it equal to an array that lists these three penguins! (Hint: remember you can put variable names inside an array, not just hard-coded values! And remember that variable names don't have quotes around them.)

/* xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Question 2: 
Access the first penguin in the list and print it to the console using console.log() -- notice that you can see all the properties and methods of that object listed in the console! (Hint: remember that array indexes start counting at 0, not 1!)

Question 3: 
Create a new variable called secondPenguin and set it equal to the second penguin in your penguins array.

Question 4: 
Print to the console the name of the last penguin in the list.

Question 6: 
Print the length of the penguins array to the console.

Question 7: 
Write one more line of code to change the first penguin's canFly property to the value true (overriding its existing value).

Question 8: 
Call the sayHello method of the first penguin in your penguins array!
